## Backstory
<p>I've always been a sports fanatic, especially around soccer as it's the sport I played since I was younger,
this was one of my first projects as I felt that working around data from a topic that I peresonally like would
make the experience of working of it much more enjoyable and the learning process of it much easier.</p>
